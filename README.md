# Office of Urban Innovation

The Office of Urban Innovation's primary focus is to improve city government services and operations so as to ensure Worcester is well situated to address the needs of its residents, businesses, and visitors.

## Genesis and Purpose

This project was initiated as a result of conversations green field exercise related to how different tech stacks could potentially improve the overall functionality of the city's website.  This repo was intended to serve as proof of concept as to how that could be accomplished.  

## Planned enhancements

The current iteration is primarily a static website built on Angular (v12.x) and Tailwind CSS.  Future releases will include dynamic content such as:
  1) Info and datasets from the open data portal (aka Informing Worcester) using that platform's native API
  2) Interactive visualizations using Tableau and/or other tools such as Billboard, D3, or ChartJs
